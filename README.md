# edx_abs
Python scripts for performing absorption correction on 3D STEM-EDX data

Installation

The main dependency for the package is pycuda. Full installation instructions 
for pycuda can be found at https://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Installation or, alternatively, a more up to date instruction for Windows can be found at https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Installing_PyCUDA_On_Anaconda_For_Windows?lang=en.

Note, pycuda is dependent on CUDA and can therefore only be run on PCs with compatible nvidia graphics cards.
